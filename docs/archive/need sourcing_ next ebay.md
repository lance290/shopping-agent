**Ebay 2.0.  Ebay for the ai agent era….**

Let’s start a newco:  “[BuyAnything.ai](http://BuyAnything.ai)”  
An ai agent facilitated marketplace where the ai agent invites/onboards/matches buyers and sellers of anything.  B2c, b2b, c2c…   

UI is simple: Chat with agent on left, tiles on right. Click on a tile see the faq/chat log

- Buyers see tiles of the seller’s bids on their needs  
- Sellers see tiles of the buyer’s needs for which they might want to bid.

Agent  starts by engaging a buyer:  in chat is says what can I help you buy today?  When a buyer tells them, the agent gets to work.   

Agent then

- asks the LLM what are the choice factors for this item and asks those questions of the buyer to fill out their “rfp” by just chatting.    
- Agent searches mcp of google shopping to find matches and the choice factors and shows a row of initial tile results  
  - If shopify has an api.mcp searches there too  
- First tile shows what they want to buy and choice factor highlights, rest of tiles in the row are the options  
- Each row in the right side UI is another think the buyer is looking to procure.  Rows can be grouped and indented under a project.   So an upcoming trip “project” might have a row each for airline, for hotel, for activities, for restaurants.

Buyer:

- Can thumbs up/down any tile to move it to the left of the row  
- Can copylink to share with collaborators  
- Can like/comment/share any tile or the whole row  
- Can hit “select” and it is moved to the left most tile with a special border to say it has been locked in.      
- As buyer clicks, the tiles suggested get smarter.

Sellers

- Your “bid” is automatic if your product is on ecommerce. BuyAnything inserts affiliate codes for match so we get paid a commission on each purchase from an ecommerce tile.  
- Agent sources more sellers/bidders  
- asks LLM what vendors sell that item in the city of the buyer  
- Agent looks up on [wattdata.ai](http://wattdata.ai) mcp the email/cell of the seller and reaches out to them with the “rfp” (the faq of the seller’s need)  
- Seller clicks and gets same UI as buyer.  Buyer sees seller bid tiles, Seller sees buyer rfp tiles.  
- Seller can bid on the project by answering the key questions to the agent, and adding links to their products/services.

Matching

- When buyer has selected the bid, if it is ecommerce they just click and buy  
- If it is b2b requiring a contract, agent helps both sides get the docusign joint signed.

Monetization:  
Typical ecommerce commission is 2-10%.   

Channels:

- Paid ads.  Use google ads to get the early buyers to post their needs  
- Viral: each buyer causes the agent to reach out to dozens of sellers, and each seller then can have the agent reach out to all their potential buyers. A flywheel.  The agent might post the items on ebay for them, etc too.     
- Viral: a seller sells one thing and buys many others, so each seller can also post what they need to buy.  Going through all the typical 7 layers of a supply chain.

We start with a super generic UI with chat \+ tiles \+ FAQ when you click on a tile.  The questions asked by the agent and the Q\&A in the FAQ are different, but we try to keep that same UI for every different product, like ebay and craigslist use the same UI for everything.    If we need to customize the UI/workflow for any verticals, very easy with vibecoding to do that.
