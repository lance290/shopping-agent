1. Run the `/audit` macro in Windsurf with optional focus text (e.g., `/audit please check the app for performance and efficiency`).
2. The macro will emit the `# cfoi.audit.v1` YAML block with findings, recommendations, and action items.
3. Review the audit results and prioritize fixes based on severity and impact.
4. Create tasks or issues for significant findings that require immediate attention.
5. Use audit results to inform refactoring priorities and technical debt planning.
