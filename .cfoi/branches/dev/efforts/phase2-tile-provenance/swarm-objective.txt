Objective: Implement Tile Detail & Provenance Panel

Context:
- Goal: When buyer clicks a tile, show WHY it was recommended
- PRD: docs/prd/phase2/prd-tile-provenance.md
- Codebase: Next.js frontend (apps/frontend), FastAPI backend (apps/backend)
- Current state: Search returns bids with basic data, no provenance field yet

Requirements:
1. Backend: Add `provenance` field to search response containing matched_features, intent_match_score, price_match
2. Frontend: Create TileDetailPanel component that slides out when tile clicked
3. Panel must show: title, price, merchant, image, rating, "Why recommended" section
4. Panel must include Like, Comment, Select action buttons
5. Load time <300ms (use cached bid data)
6. WCAG 2.1 AA accessible (keyboard nav, screen reader)

Files to Consider:
- apps/backend/sourcing/service.py (add provenance to search)
- apps/backend/sourcing/repository.py (provenance data model)
- apps/frontend/components/RowStrip.tsx (tile click handler)
- apps/frontend/components/ (new TileDetailPanel.tsx)
- apps/frontend/app/store.ts (selected tile state)

Success Criteria:
- Clicking tile opens detail panel
- Panel shows at least one matched feature
- Panel closes on escape key or click outside
- All tests pass
