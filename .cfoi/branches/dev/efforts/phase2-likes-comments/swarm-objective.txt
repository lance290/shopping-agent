Objective: Fix Likes & Comments Persistence

Context:
- Goal: Likes and comments must survive page reload
- PRD: docs/prd/phase2/prd-likes-comments.md
- Codebase: Next.js frontend (apps/frontend), FastAPI backend (apps/backend)
- Current state: Backend endpoints exist, frontend UI exists, but persistence is untested/broken

Requirements:
1. Backend: Verify /bids/{bid_id}/like and /bids/{bid_id}/comments endpoints work
2. Frontend: Ensure like state syncs to backend on click
3. Frontend: Restore like state from backend on page load
4. Frontend: Save comments with user attribution
5. Frontend: Show like/comment counts on tiles
6. Like toggle must complete in <200ms (optimistic UI)

Files to Consider:
- apps/backend/routes/bids.py (like/comment endpoints)
- apps/backend/models.py (Like, Comment models)
- apps/frontend/components/RowStrip.tsx (like button)
- apps/frontend/app/store.ts (like state management)
- apps/frontend/app/api/ (API calls)

Success Criteria:
- Like a tile, refresh page, like still shows
- Add comment, refresh page, comment still shows
- Collaborators see each other's likes/comments
- All tests pass
