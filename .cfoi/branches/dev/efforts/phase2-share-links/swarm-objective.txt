Objective: Implement Share Links

Context:
- Goal: Buyers can share projects/rows/tiles via URL for viral growth
- PRD: docs/prd/phase2/prd-share-links.md
- Codebase: Next.js frontend (apps/frontend), FastAPI backend (apps/backend)
- Current state: No share functionality exists

Requirements:
1. Backend: Create share_links table (token, resource_type, resource_id, created_by, access_count)
2. Backend: POST /share endpoint to create share link
3. Backend: GET /s/{token} endpoint to resolve share link
4. Frontend: "Copy Link" button on project, row, and tile
5. Frontend: Share link resolver page that shows read-only view
6. Track share access_count for analytics

Files to Consider:
- apps/backend/models.py (ShareLink model)
- apps/backend/routes/ (new share.py)
- apps/frontend/components/RowStrip.tsx (copy link button)
- apps/frontend/app/s/[token]/page.tsx (share resolver)
- apps/frontend/app/store.ts (share state)

Success Criteria:
- Click "Copy Link" copies URL to clipboard
- Paste URL in new browser, see shared content
- Anonymous user sees read-only view
- access_count increments on view
- All tests pass
