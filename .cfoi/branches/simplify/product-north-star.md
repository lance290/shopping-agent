# Product North Star: BuyAnything

**Mission**: Enable anyone to source anything — from AA batteries to mega-yachts — through a single conversational interface that understands what kind of help you need and responds accordingly.

**North Star Metric**: Desire Fulfillment Rate — the percentage of user requests that result in a meaningful next step (purchase, quote request, vendor connection, or advisory referral) appropriate to the desire tier.

**Core Principle**: The system should behave like a world-class concierge — invisible when it works. Batteries go to Amazon instantly. Jet charters go to specialist brokers with structured RFPs. The user never thinks about the routing.
